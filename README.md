# **Health Expense Analysis & Prediction**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project analyzes healthcare expenses using machine learning and statistical techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing costs and develop predictive models for future healthcare expenditures.  

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Neural Networks, SVM  
- **Data Processing**: Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deployment**: Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 **Key Insights**  
- **Smokers incur 70% higher healthcare costs.**  
- **Non-exercisers pay 2X more in medical expenses.**  
- **Predictive models forecast healthcare expenses with 86% accuracy.**  

## 🚀 **Project Features**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover expense trends  
- Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques  
- Forecasting healthcare expenses over the next three years  
- Data-driven insights for cost optimization and risk assessment  

## 📂 **Files & Structure**  
- `Health_expense_2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and model development  
- `data/` – Folder containing healthcare records dataset  
- `results/` – Outputs from predictions and visualizations
